# HEADER FILE
# to keep track of functions and variables in the code
# be descriptive
# separate different sections of code with horizontal lines to keep it clean 
#	(ie. one section for the temperature gradient variables and functions, etc).
#	title each section for ease of searching

# examples:

// speed of light in m/s
** the type of c is a constant integer 
const int c = 3*10^(8);

// age of the universe in Gyr
** the variable "uni_years" has type integer
int uni_years = 13;

// computes distance in light has traveled in given time
** the function "light_dist" takes in an integer named time and returns an integer
int light_dist(int time); 

** these lines explain the C syntax used for type clarity; they are only there for
	illustrative purposes and don't need to be included in your variable/function descriptions.

// please include short descriptions above each declaration
